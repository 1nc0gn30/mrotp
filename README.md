otp bot for fun and EDUCATIONAL PURPOSES
this is a basic otp bot that can perform calls to any given number with restrictions in mind. must have a twilio account set up with money added to account to perform calls with this bot. also highly suggest paying for ngrok rather than the free plan to adhere more tunnels with less restrictions. please mind using this bot as you can easily perform malicious tasks at hand. please make sure you when you setup your discord bot that you give it necessary priveliges to perform your tasks. last but not least it is your duty to configure the files accordingly so they work with your environment. such ass renaming a couple directories and filling in twilio sid, account, ngrok account/url, discord token, twilio number, twilio message, flask routes, ect.
